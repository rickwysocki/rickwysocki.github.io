I"*<p>Hey, y’all!</p>

<p>I put a new song up on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rlw1234">soundcloud</a> last night. I’ve been focusing a lot on the dissertation/job market (obviously) and some web design projects in my free time, so my music has been taking a little bit of a back seat.</p>

<p>If you don’t know, music was one of my first loves (far earlier than academia, actually), and I produce electronic music as a hobby. I’ve been forever working on an EP that I’ll put out someday. But not today.</p>

<p>Instead, last night I just convinced myself to compose something short that sounded nice and avoided falling into the familiar tracks of “overthinking it.” So, here it is–if you like it, let me know!</p>
