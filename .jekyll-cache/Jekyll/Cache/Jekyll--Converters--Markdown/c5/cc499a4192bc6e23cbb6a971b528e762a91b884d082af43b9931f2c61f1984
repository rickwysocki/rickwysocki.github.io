I"Ç<p>Alright, Iâ€™ve got this Jekyll thing up and running now. <!--more--> Actually, Iâ€™m writing this while the blog is still contained on my local serverâ€¦ Hereâ€™s hoping getting it up on Github doesnâ€™t give me too much trouble. (Though thatâ€™s half the fun of course). If youâ€™re reading this, I guess I figured it all out.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve decided to make my life both more difficult and more interesting by having two separate websites, <a href="http://www.rickwysocki.com">one for my academic portfolio/general intellectual projects</a> and this site, my blog [NOTE FROM THE FUTUREâ€“THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE]. While I will often blog about my life as a doctoral student/scholar, I will also most likely be blogging about other things that interest me, so <em>be warned.</em> Just kidding, I think.</p>

<p>Anyway, Iâ€™m digging this system (and kind of kicking myself that I didnâ€™t build my portfolio with Jekyll, but oh well). Hereâ€™s to writing!</p>
