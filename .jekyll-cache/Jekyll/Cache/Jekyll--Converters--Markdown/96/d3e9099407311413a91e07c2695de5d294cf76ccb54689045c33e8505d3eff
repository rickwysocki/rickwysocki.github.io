I"‚<p>I have a stack of former studentsâ€™ reflection papers on my desk in front of me. <!--more-->As Iâ€™m drafting this blog post, Iâ€™m picking one up when Iâ€™m not sure what to write.</p>

<p>I tell my students that all writers struggle to produce words, and that picking up other writersâ€™ texts can help break through what often feels like a barrier between yourself and the page. (Or, more likely, the screen.) It makes me glad to use <em>their</em> writing for this task now, since so many of them entered my introductory college composition course with devalued ideas about their capabilities and possibilities as writers.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I submitted the grades for my two sections of Business Writing this semester. The next day, I cleaned out my office desk. I am privileged to have been granted a dissertation fellowship for my final year at my university, during which Iâ€™ll be able to focus entirely on my research and the job-market-marathon beginning in the fall.</p>

<p>It feels odd knowing that Iâ€™ll likely never teach another course at the University of Louisville. Apart from a largely disastrous preceptorial course I organized in my undergraduate Honors program (a story for another time), I learned everything I know about teaching here. My first courses were fall and spring of 2014-15, one a section of introductory college composition and the other a more research-focused composition course. Since then, Iâ€™ve taught multiple sections of business writing, scientific and technical writing, and an American literature survey. I learned so much in simply teaching each course.</p>

<p>This post is more of a historical marker for me than a narrative or argument, I suppose. I just feel so lucky to have worked with my students, and to know that while Iâ€™ll be out of the classroom for a year, a future of teaching awaits me on the other side of this dissertation. Speaking of whichâ€¦</p>
