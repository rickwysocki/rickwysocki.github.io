I"Ä<p>Once a week, I post a list of ten songs I canâ€™t stop playing, and brief descriptions of why. Er, the goal is once a week. Since Iâ€™ve fallen off posting (and lost a few posts in the series when moving my blog), Iâ€™ve decided to rebrand this series as â€œSonic Sleuthâ€ and try to get back into the weekly posts. So, in any case, feel free to follow if you want to hear some cool songs and read some nerdy thoughts about music. I promise Iâ€™ll try to deliver some every week.</p>

<h2 id="lose-your-love-by-joe-goddard">Lose Your Love by Joe Goddard</h2>

<p>The fact that this song doesnâ€™t bang as hard as it could is, to me, what makes it such a banger. A true enigma. Iâ€™ve been listening to Joe Goddardâ€™s stuff a ton lately.</p>

<h2 id="lovers-carving-by-bibio">loversâ€™ carving by Bibio</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s been a long time since Iâ€™ve gotten this into a guitar song, even though I grew up playing guitar pretty seriously. Thereâ€™s just something about this song I really dig.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-my-eyes-by-bibio">Beyond My Eyes by Bibio</h2>

<p>I try to avoid doubling up artists on these lists, but it is too strange that this song is by the same musician as the previous one. I had to include it. While theyâ€™re both great, this song is much more in my usual style. Itâ€™s got great synths and lots of development.</p>

<h2 id="bamboo-by-elder-island">Bamboo by Elder Island</h2>

<p>THIS. SONG. IS. REALLY. REALLY. REALLY. REALLY. GOOD. For real, this is one of the cooler songs Iâ€™ve heard in a while. Itâ€™s got a weird time signature that doesnâ€™t come across as weird, a mallet sound that reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y0lLwLxVX8">Oingo Boingâ€™s</a> â€œJust Another Day,â€ and great vocals. Itâ€™s slow, dance-y, soft, and in your face at different times. Just a really great song.</p>

<h2 id="alone-together-by-leisure">Alone Together by LEISURE</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s a pretty straightforward pop-song but its just works really well. I hear some Steely Dan vibes going on in the chorus. If you donâ€™t know me, that means Iâ€™m in.</p>

<h2 id="now-that-we-found-love-by-heavy-d--the-boyz">Now That We Found Love by Heavy D &amp; The Boyz</h2>

<p>I contain multitudes and if you donâ€™t like Heavy D youâ€™re messing up.</p>

<h2 id="cutlass-cruiser-by-tops">Cutlass Cruiser by TOPS</h2>

<p>This song is cool as hell. Reminds me both of great 80s pop and also the Ariel Pink-ish vibes of the years I was living in California.</p>

<p>Canâ€™t get enough of those 80s bass/guitar countermelodies. And the chorus just feels so good.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been rocking this a ton lately. No idea why (beside it being dope).</p>
