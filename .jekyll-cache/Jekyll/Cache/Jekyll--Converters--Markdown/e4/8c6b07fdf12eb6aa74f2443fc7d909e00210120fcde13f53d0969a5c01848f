I"ó<p><em>This is the first of a new series of blog posts Iâ€™m starting. Itâ€™s called â€œSongs I Loveâ€ and, obviously, itâ€™s about music I love that Iâ€™ve been listening to lately. Each Sunday, Iâ€™ll post ten songs Iâ€™ve been listening to lately and give one-ish sentence descriptions explaining why I love them. If you want to follow along at home, Iâ€™ll post links to the individual songs on Spotify and Youtube, when possible, as well as a full playlist at the bottom of the post.</em></p>
