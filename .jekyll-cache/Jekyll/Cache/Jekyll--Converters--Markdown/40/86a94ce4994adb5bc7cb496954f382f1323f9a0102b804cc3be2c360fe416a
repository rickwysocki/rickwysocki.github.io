I"<p>A lot’s been going on recently.<!--more--></p>

<p>I should say, first, that I’ve added some new information to my website. I’ve updated my <a href="https://rickwysocki.com/research/">research</a>, <a href="https://rickwysocki.com/teaching/">teaching</a>, and <a href="https://rickwysocki.com/curriculum-vitae/">CV</a> pages with revised documents, and have added some pages to begin showcasing some of my <a href="https://rickwysocki.com/portfolio/">creative work</a>. There’s scant content there now, but I’ll add pages for my electronic music, design work, and very amateur photography over the next couple of weeks. A lot of this will change, but I’m slowly trying to take control of my digital self, a decision that’s leading me to delete my Facebook at the end end of the week.</p>

<p>But here’s the more important <i>a lots</i> that have been going on recently.</p>

<p>I’ve completed four chapters of my dissertation. It feels unreal, and I’m surprisingly happy with what I’ve produced so far. I’m getting to spend a lot more time with my partner, her dog (my other dog), and my cat, who are all now sharing the same space with us. It’s wonderful. I’m also on the on ramp the academic job market. It’s going to be a long but rewarding year.</p>
