I"è<p>Once a week, I post a list of ten songs I canâ€™t stop playing, and brief descriptions of why. Er, the goal is once a week. Since Iâ€™ve fallen off posting (and lost a few posts in the series when moving my blog), Iâ€™ve decided to rebrand this series as â€œSonic Sleuthâ€ and try to get back into the weekly posts. So, in any case, feel free to follow if you want to hear some cool songs and read some nerdy thoughts about music. I promise Iâ€™ll try to deliver some every week.</p>
