I"œ<p>Once a week, I post a list of ten songs I can‚Äôt stop playing, and brief descriptions of why. <!--more-->Er, the goal is once a week. Since I‚Äôve fallen off posting (and lost a few posts in the series when moving my blog), I‚Äôve decided to rebrand this series as ‚ÄúSonic Sleuth‚Äù and try to get back into the weekly posts. So, in any case, feel free to follow if you want to hear some cool songs and read some nerdy thoughts about music. I promise I‚Äôll try to deliver some every week.</p>

<h2 id="lose-your-love-by-joe-goddard">Lose Your Love by Joe Goddard</h2>

<p>The fact that this song doesn‚Äôt bang as hard as it could is, to me, what makes it such a banger. A true enigma. I‚Äôve been listening to Joe Goddard‚Äôs stuff a ton lately.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve gotten this into a guitar song, even though I grew up playing guitar pretty seriously. There‚Äôs just something about this song I really dig.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-my-eyes-by-bibio">Beyond My Eyes by Bibio</h2>

<p>I try to avoid doubling up artists on these lists, but it is too strange that this song is by the same musician as the previous one. I had to include it. While they‚Äôre both great, this song is much more in my usual style. It‚Äôs got great synths and lots of development.</p>

<h2 id="bamboo-by-elder-island">Bamboo by Elder Island</h2>

<p>THIS. SONG. IS. REALLY. REALLY. REALLY. REALLY. GOOD. For real, this is one of the cooler songs I‚Äôve heard in a while. It‚Äôs got a weird time signature that doesn‚Äôt come across as weird, a mallet sound that reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y0lLwLxVX8">Oingo Boing‚Äôs</a> ‚ÄúJust Another Day,‚Äù and great vocals. It‚Äôs slow, dance-y, soft, and in your face at different times. Just a really great song.</p>

<h2 id="alone-together-by-leisure">Alone Together by LEISURE</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs a pretty straightforward pop-song but its just works really well. I hear some Steely Dan vibes going on in the chorus. If you don‚Äôt know me, that means I‚Äôm in.</p>

<h2 id="cutlass-cruiser-by-tops">Cutlass Cruiser by TOPS</h2>

<p>This song is cool as hell. Reminds me both of great 80s pop and also the Ariel Pink-ish vibes of the years I was living in California.</p>

<p>Can‚Äôt get enough of those 80s bass/guitar countermelodies. And the chorus just feels so good.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been rocking this a ton lately. No idea why (beside it being dope).</p>
