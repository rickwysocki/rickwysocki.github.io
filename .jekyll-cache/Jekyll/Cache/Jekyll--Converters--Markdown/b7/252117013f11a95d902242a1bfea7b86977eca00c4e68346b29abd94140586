I"õ<p>A brief post:</p>

<p>In the coming weeks Iâ€™m planning to settle into a more regular work schedule. More writing, more reading, more time in the archives. Less messing around. Especially less time dorking around on social media. Part of the way Iâ€™m going to try to stay focused is update this blog more regularly discussing the steps I take toward long and short term goals. According to my journal, these goals include:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    - Write 3000 words of my dissertation in the next week and a half
    - Finish this website
    - Send out an article in June
    - Finish the EP Iâ€™ve been working on
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s to some productive work.</p>
