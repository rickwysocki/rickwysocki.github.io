<h2 id="say-yes-by-elliott-smith">Say Yes by Elliott Smith</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve always loved Elliott Smith. There‚Äôs something about the interaction of the vocal melody and the guitar part that is just so incredible on this song. And, because it‚Äôs Elliott Smith, the lyrics are amazing.</p>

<p>Just started listening to this album, and it is excellent. Gives me some serious Erykah Badu vibes (among others) in a way that I‚Äôm not sure anything else has. It‚Äôs dope.</p>
