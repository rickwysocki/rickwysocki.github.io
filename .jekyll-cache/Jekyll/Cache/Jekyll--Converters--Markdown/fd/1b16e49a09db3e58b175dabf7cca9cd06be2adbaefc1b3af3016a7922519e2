The uncertainty generated over national security during World War I made it possible for Congress to pass this legislation, and it included several important provisions that paved the way for the 1924.</p><cite><a class="citation" href="#Milestones">(“Milestones: 1921–1936 - Office of the Historian,” n.d.)</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>[T]he American Immigration Restriction Act of 1924 was applauded by German racial hygienists. . .. Bavarian Health Inspector Walter Schultz wrote that German racial hygienists should learn from the United States how to restrict the influx of Jews and eastern and southern Europeans. . . . One other important German figure, in a famous book from 1924, was full of praise for the fact that the Immigration Restriction Act excluded 'undesirables' on the basis of hereditary illness and race. His name was Adolph Hitler; the book was *Mein Kampf.</p><cite><a class="citation" href="#Kuhl1994">(Kühl, 1994, p. 38)</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>American immigration laws designed to keep out people with hereditary diseases and citizens from non-Nordic countries won special approval in Germany. In February 1934, Hans F. K. Gunther, race anthropologist and a special protege of the Nazis, explained to his audience in a crowded hall at the University of Munich that it was remarkable that "American immigration laws were accepted by the overwhelming majority, although the United States appeared the most liberal country of the world." He referred to [United States eugenicists Madison] Grant and [Lothrap] Stoddard as the "spiritual fathers" of immigration legislation and proposed that the laws serve as a model for Germany. Nazi racial hygienists were especially impressed by the way in which American immigration policy combined eugenic and ethnic selection.</p><cite><a class="citation" href="#Kuhl1994">(Kühl, 1994, p. 38)</a></cite></blockquote>
