I"◊<p>Here‚Äôs this week‚Äôs ‚Äúsonic sleuth‚Äù post, where I list ten songs I can‚Äôt stop playing, and brief descriptions of why. <!--more-->Feel free to follow if you want to hear some cool songs and read some nerdy thoughts about music. I promise I‚Äôll try to deliver some every week.</p>

<h2 id="dopamine-by-franc-moody">Dopamine by Franc Moody</h2>

<p>The bass line is so good. So, so good. Reminds me of Teddy Prendergass and also the Ohio Players for some reason.</p>

<h2 id="shouldnt-have-done-that-by-two-another">Shouldn‚Äôt Have Done That by Two Another</h2>

<p>This song sounds like what I always wished Sam Smith sounded like. That‚Äôs not to take anything away from either artist (I‚Äôm really digging this band and have always liked Sam Smith, too), but I can‚Äôt get over the mix between the crooning vocals and the ethereal synthesizers here.</p>

<h2 id="judy-french-by-white-reaper">Judy French by White Reaper</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôve ever lived in Louisville you can‚Äôt not love White Reaper. This band rules.</p>

<h2 id="dripping-by-blonde-redhead">Dripping by Blonde Redhead</h2>

<p>I got to see Blonde Redhead at a festival at some point (it was either Coachella or Austin City Limits) and it was fantastic. This band is incredible and deserves more props than it gets.</p>

<h2 id="what-would-i-want-sky-by-animal-collective">What Would I Want? Sky by Animal Collective</h2>

<p>Okay I know everyone and their dog‚Äôs dad probably knows this song but I‚Äôve been listening to it again lately. It‚Äôs so dope that the Grateful Dead let Animal Collective sample ‚ÄúUnbroken Chain‚Äù‚Äìthe first time the Dead had ever cleared a sample.</p>

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3RQDauUKDwVNsg2IVypyMo?si=KBnL1DaxSGe_joYU-zctUg">Spotify Link</a></p>

<h2 id="first-time-high-remix-of-an-eluardian-instance-by-of-montreal-by-recontructionist">First Time High (Remix of An Eluardian Instance by Of Montreal) by Recontructionist</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm aware that this is a very complicated title. To be clear, it‚Äôs a remix of an Of Montreal song by an artist called Reconstructionist. Not totally sure where I came across this, but I dig it, and am a forever-fan of Of Montreal.</p>

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3uD7fHUG9OYARp958ZIlFr?si=UFSsxrJARGmwdcvIsx5ybA">Spotify Link</a></p>

<h2 id="god-by-kendrick-lamar">GOD. by Kendrick Lamar</h2>

<p>Not trying to argue with anyone about this, but Kendrick is my personal favorite rapper. DAMN was such an incredible album (LOVE. is one of my all-time favorite songs). GOD. doesn‚Äôt seem to get talked about as much as it should, though. So, here, listen to it and think about how great it is. If you want.</p>

<h2 id="hustle-formation-by-the-go-team">Hustle Formation by The GO! Team</h2>

<p>Seidenfaden‚Äôs.</p>

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6O61pROWlBVw4T6RszE4C4?si=Xqt4iDp2QJe2o7HHmOfvVA">Spotify Link</a></p>

<h2 id="rock-n-roll-star-by-kero-kero-bonito">Rock n Roll Star by Kero Kero Bonito</h2>

<p>If you want to know what my musical taste is, this is a pretty good distillation of it. Occasionally glitchy electronic drums, 80s vibes, movement through a couple different moods, vocal harmonies‚Äìthis song has it all.</p>

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5TlobeBLLovqgVtwq4zTCp?si=8kRu5FavQLK3W4MSQaaYvA">Spotify Link</a></p>

<h2 id="shock-doctrine-by-sts9">Shock Doctrine by STS9</h2>

<p>This song brings me back to high school so hard. I love it. (As a political aside, also read Naomi Klein‚Äôs book that this song is named after: <em>Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.</em>)</p>
