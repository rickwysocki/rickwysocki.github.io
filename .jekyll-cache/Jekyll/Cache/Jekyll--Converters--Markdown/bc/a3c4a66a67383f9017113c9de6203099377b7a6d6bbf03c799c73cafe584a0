I"ü<p>A lotâ€™s been going on recently.</p>

<p>I should say, first, that Iâ€™ve added some new information to my website. Iâ€™ve updated my <a href="https://rickwysocki.com/research/">research</a>, <a href="https://rickwysocki.com/teaching/">teaching</a>, and <a href="https://rickwysocki.com/curriculum-vitae/">CV</a> pages with revised documents, and have added some pages to begin showcasing some of my <a href="https://rickwysocki.com/portfolio/">creative work</a>. Thereâ€™s scant content there now, but Iâ€™ll add pages for my electronic music, design work, and very amateur photography over the next couple of weeks. A lot of this will change, but Iâ€™m slowly trying to take control of my digital self, a decision thatâ€™s leading me to delete my Facebook at the end end of the week.</p>

<p>But hereâ€™s the more important <i>a lots</i> that have been going on recently.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve completed four chapters of my dissertation. It feels unreal, and Iâ€™m surprisingly happy with what Iâ€™ve produced so far. Iâ€™m getting to spend a lot more time with my partner, her dog (my other dog), and my cat, who are all now sharing the same space with us. Itâ€™s wonderful. Iâ€™m also on the on ramp the academic job market. Itâ€™s going to be a long but rewarding year.</p>
