I am a voter in Delaware County. I am writing to urge you to support the legislation titled "The Green New Deal," submitted by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey. Let me explain why.

It is no longer possible to ignore the reality of climate disruption. A recent IPCC report notes the dangers of global warming 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures, and that even if we were to reach neutral carbon emissions now, we may still reach that threshold. The consequences will be extraordinarily far-reaching. Take only two examples:

1. The report notes that "Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 2°C." Human life is already being already be disrupted by climate change, and we must take strategic action to mitigate global harm.

2. The dangers of climate disruption have the  first and worst consquences on the most vulnerable populations: "Populations at disproportionately higher risk of adverse consequences with global warming of 1.5°C and beyond include disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, some indigenous peoples, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods (high confidence)." Furthermore, sea-level rise is being predicted by researchers to lead to mass and disruptive migration across the country, and UNHCR is predicting the emergence of a  refugee crisis due to climate disruption. 

3. Even if we could keep temperatures under 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, that would not prevent harm. As the IPCC reports, "Any increase in global warming is projected to affect human health, with primarily negative consequences (high confidence)." We cannot play defense. We have to have an active and consequential strategy for mitigating the realities of climate change.

The Green New Deal is this strategy.
