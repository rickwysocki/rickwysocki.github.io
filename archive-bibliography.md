## Bibliography - Archives

### Description

This is my attempt to scrape together my massive but unorganized bibliography of archives-related sources. It is a work in process.

Initially, the list may slant toward rhetoric studies, queer archives, and various subsets of cultural, social, and media theory. This is only because these are the sources my work has heavily engaged with so far, and I'll be making an active effort to round out this list as I go forward. Additionally, because my notes are exploded across a number of print and digital media, not all of these existing bibliographic entries will be added at once.

If you would like to contribute bibliographic entries to this project, please use the comments section at the bottom of this page.
