<p>I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at Ball State University. I research queer rhetoric, new materialism, and archives. Additionally, I have been involved in a number of digital publishing efforts, most notably as a Section Editor at <a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net">Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology and Pedagogy.</a></p>
