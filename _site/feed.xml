&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump is in no uncertain terms a fascist. &lt;!--more--&gt; Specifically, Trump activates the latent microfasiscms of everyday life in the United States, gradually and clearly transforming them into a form of macro state fascism. I have no qualms about impeachment. But I do question the &lt;em&gt;ways&lt;/em&gt; that centrist-liberals frame impeachment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider #impeachmentparty. As with many viral phenomena, it is difficult to trace the hashtag’s point of emergence, but the among the more prominent examples I saw was Ava Duvernay’s, which read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are dressed and ready for the #ImpeachmentParty. What are you wearing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We are dressed and ready for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImpeachmentParty?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#ImpeachmentParty&lt;/a&gt;. What are you wearing? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Svwqw3RWAh&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Svwqw3RWAh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ava DuVernay (@ava) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ava/status/1176631308237197313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 24, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text was accompanied by an image of Duvernay, and others, in the fanciest of red carpet regalia, with Duvernay pointing to the camera as though her finger might somehow reverse the course of our slow but consistent descent into fascism. The tweet garnered over eighty-three thousand likes, ten-thousand retweets, and eighteen-hundren replies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers were unfortunately insufficient in their seeming attempt to remove Trump from office. Apparently the mechanisms of the US government require a greater level of engagement to function properly. Sarcasm aside, I want to suggest that this tweet is symptomatic of a discourse so tied to the “spectacle” that it seemingly just forgets rather obvious points related to history, cause and effect, and political strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy Debord theorized the “society of the spectacle” as the seamless integration of social representation, society, and capital. Politics, in this society, becomes a &lt;em&gt;spectacle&lt;/em&gt; to be  passively viewed at a distance, rather than a grounded practice to be engaged democratically. In “The State of Spectacle,” Debord writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have seen the falsification getting thicker, descending to the fabrication of the most trivial things, like a sticky fog which accumulates at the ground level of daily life. We have seen a striving for the absolute–as far as “telematic” madness–in the technical and police control of men and natural forces, a control whose errors grow as fast as its methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the first target of this analysis today should &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; be powerful politicians, technocrats, and certain media establishments who have reduced political realities to a onslaught of representations. These representations work to dissuade political subjectivity through a slow drip of dis- and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the advertising-based Internet model incentivizes engagement over truth, leading these representations to transform according to the whims of powerful corporations and their ability to cynically mobilize enormous numbers of individuals while simultaneously dissuading the possibility of a coherent political subjectivity. As Natasha Lennard has powerfully written in her excellent book &lt;em&gt;Being Numerous&lt;/em&gt;, “We participate in the social order. . . but we have not yet (for now) chosen to be collective, or communized or united” (118).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The society of the spectacle existed long before Trump. One of the gravest errors I notice in much of liberal-left thinking is the idea that Trump birthed the circus of half-truths that we call modern political life. In fact, it is the opposite, as a figure like Trump could &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; gain political power in a society already primed for the spectacle, a point made well in Adam Curtis’s postmodern, almost somnambulistic documentary &lt;em&gt;Hypernormalisation&lt;/em&gt;. (I will leave it to readers to draw their own conclusions about Curtis’s postmodern documentary style.) It is undeniable, however, that Trump has radically accelerated the spectacularization of political life, and that he is a uniquely and globally dangerous figure. It is similarly undeniable that, if you have made it this far, you already know that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s return to the hashtag. What worries me about #impeachmentparty, as well as the visual rhetoric performed by Duvernay’s image, is that it further sediments a representation of political power as something given rather than collectively built. Most importantly, I worry that #impeachmentparty aestheticizes resistance to Trump in a way that is quite unhelpful. Precarious viewers might read Duvernay’s red carpet party as a return to normalcy for a social elite rather than as a pointing to a truly progressive future. More pragmatically, I worry that this representation and others like it may dissaude unactivated, non-Trump voters from showing out at the polls. (An important first step against beating fascism, of course, is beating Trump.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headlines referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7501249/Rosie-ODonnell-Ava-Duvernay-Hollywood-elites-celebrating-Pelosis-impeachment-inquiry.html&quot;&gt;“Hollywood Elites”&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/juiciest-donald-trump-impeachment-memes-nancy-pelosi&quot;&gt;“juciest memes”&lt;/a&gt;, in my view, only sediment a distanced, acontextual view of what impeachment means. Throwing this into focus was the fact that, within days, Nancy Pelosi had already begun attempts to narrow the impeachement inquiries focus to Trump’s dealings with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to be bleak. There is no mandate that attending to representation must be regressive. Walter Benjamin famously claimed that while fascism aestheticizes politics, communism responds by politicizing art. From this perspective, there are ways that the representations made available to us through artistic expression can function to move forward positive and progressive political aims. Furthermore, as Natalie Wynn wonderfully argued, abandoning aesthetics leaves often makes the Left seem quite uncool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all that said, all vectors of the left-of-center would do well to avoid an aesthetic that reinscribes a normalcy of the elite. Rather, we need an inclusive aesthetic–such as AOC’s instagram chats–that seeks to grow the progressive base. Given concentration camps on our southern border, the continuation and re-emeregence of regressive social policy, and a rapidly deteriorating planet, perhaps it is not yet time to party.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="web-design life" /><summary type="html">Donald Trump is in no uncertain terms a fascist.</summary></entry></feed>
