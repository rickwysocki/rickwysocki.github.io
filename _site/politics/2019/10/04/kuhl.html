<meta name="description" content="refugee camps came after WWI (Robson, 2019) a primary reason for refugee camps is racism and xenophobia, and not want refugees to populate a white society. [T]he anti-semitism and xenophobia sweeping western Europe and the United States ushered in an era of new and draconian immigration restrictions. In the U.S., the 1924 &#39;National Origins&#39; Act (which would not be undone until 1965) sought to return the United States to an earlier (whiter) ethnic composition by imposing immigration quotas and banning immigration from Asia entirely. . . . In such an atmosphere, camps proved to be an easier way to keep tabs on refugees and ensure a lockdown of the borders. . . . So the camps model prevailed--not because it was good for refugees, but because camps were valuable for preventing immigration into Britain and France and useful for the imperial project abroad.(Robson, 2019, p. 24) In 1917, the U.S. Congress enacted the first widely restrictive immigration law. The uncertainty generated over national security during World War I made it possible for Congress to pass this legislation, and it included several important provisions that paved the way for the 1924.(“Milestones: 1921–1936 - Office of the Historian,” n.d.) Immigration Act of 1917 included: literacy test (in any language) for immigrants 16 and up increased immigrant taxes excluded “anyone born in a geographically defined “Asiatic Barred Zone” except for Japanese and Filipinos.” Chinese people were already unable to immigrate due to the Chinese Exclusion Act. (“Milestones: 1921–1936 - Office of the Historian,” n.d.) Then Vermont Republican Senator William P. Dillingham introduces an immigration quota at 350,000, but did not apply to Western hemisphere In 1924 the number is pushed down further. Additionally: Another change to the quota altered the basis of the quota calculations. The quota had been based on the number of people born outside of the United States, or the number of immigrants in the United States. The new law traced the origins of the whole of the U.S. population, including natural-born citizens. The new quota calculations included large numbers of people of British descent whose families had long resided in the United States. As a result, the percentage of visas available to individuals from the British Isles and Western Europe increased, but newer immigration from other areas like Southern and Eastern Europe was limited.(“Milestones: 1921–1936 - Office of the Historian,” n.d.) Also forbid entry of any individuals whose race and / or nationality barred them from naturalizing. Laws from 1790 and 1870 excluded Asian people from nationalizing, including the Japanese. This broke the countries’ informan “Gentleman’s Agreement,” whereby the US would not restrict Japanese immigration, and Japan would stop emigration to the US. “In all of its parts, the most basic purpose of the 1924 Immigration Act was to preserve the ideal of U.S. homogeneity. Congress revised the Act in 1952” (“Milestones: 1921–1936 - Office of the Historian,” n.d.). [T]he American Immigration Restriction Act of 1924 was applauded by German racial hygienists. . .. Bavarian Health Inspector Walter Schultz wrote that German racial hygienists should learn from the United States how to restrict the influx of Jews and eastern and southern Europeans. . . . One other important German figure, in a famous book from 1924, was full of praise for the fact that the Immigration Restriction Act excluded &#39;undesirables&#39; on the basis of hereditary illness and race. His name was Adolph Hitler; the book was *Mein Kampf.(Kühl, 1994, p. 38) 24-25 30 38-39 57 61 The important of the United States for German eugenicists was revealed by the allusions in nearly every German medical dissertation about sterilization in the United States as the first country to enfore comprehensive eugenics legislation.(Kühl, 1994, p. 25) American immigration laws designed to keep out people with hereditary diseases and citizens from non-Nordic countries won special approval in Germany. In February 1934, Hans F. K. Gunther, race anthropologist and a special protege of the Nazis, explained to his audience in a crowded hall at the University of Munich that it was remarkable that &quot;American immigration laws were accepted by the overwhelming majority, although the United States appeared the most liberal country of the world.&quot; He referred to [United States eugenicists Madison] Grant and [Lothrap] Stoddard as the &quot;spiritual fathers&quot; of immigration legislation and proposed that the laws serve as a model for Germany. Nazi racial hygienists were especially impressed by the way in which American immigration policy combined eugenic and ethnic selection.(Kühl, 1994, p. 38) Robson, L. (2019). Refugees &amp; The UN.
