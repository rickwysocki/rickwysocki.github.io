*This is the first of a new series of blog posts I'm starting. It's called "Songs I Love" and, obviously, it's about music I love that I've been listening to lately. Each Sunday, I'll post ten songs I've been listening to lately and give one-ish sentence descriptions explaining why I love them. If you want to follow along at home, I'll post links to the individual songs on Spotify and Youtube, when possible, as well as a full playlist at the bottom of the post.*

## Prince Rama: Never Forever

I love this song because it's weird as hell, and because they were super dope when I saw them opening for Dan Deacon. <em>[This one isn't on Spotify, so here's a Youtube link to their also weird as hell music video.]</em>

## Pavement: Transport is Arranged

One of my top five running songs--the dynamics between the soft and heavy parts are so interesting and well-produced.

## Muscles: The Lake

That chorus is just too tight. Whenever I listen to it I picture a big dance routine in my head for some reason. If you like synthesizers, this whole album is worth a listen.

## LCD Soundsystem: Someone Great

My friend and I couldn't agree whether this was a happy or a sad song (I say sad). Regardless, it's super-beautiful and is probably my favorite LCD Soundsystem track.

## Daft Punk: Something About Us

So smooth--undervalued in Daft Punk's discography in my opinion.

## Thundercat: Lava Lamp
Even smoother--Thundercat is probably my favorite artist of 2018, and also helped make To Pimp a Butterfly so good.

## Fanny J: Dis-le-moi

That's right. Zouk music rules.

## Yelle/Tepr: Ce Jeu (Tepr Remix)

I love this song because it reminds me of driving around with my friends in Dallas growing up and looking for something to do.

## Erykah Badu: Four Leaf Clover
It's Erykah Badu.

## Oneohtrix Point Never: Sticky Drama

I love this song because it's so uncomfortable and digital-grimy but simultaneously so melodic. The production is so incredible.
