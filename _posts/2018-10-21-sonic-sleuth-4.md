Here’s this week’s “sonic sleuth” post, where I list ten songs I can’t stop playing, and brief descriptions of why. <!--more-->Feel free to follow if you want to hear some cool songs and read some nerdy thoughts about music. I promise I’ll try to deliver some every week.

## Say Yes by Elliott Smith

I’ve always loved Elliott Smith. There’s something about the interaction of the vocal melody and the guitar part that is just so incredible on this song. And, because it’s Elliott Smith, the lyrics are amazing.

## Self by Noname
Just started listening to this album, and it is excellent. Gives me some serious Erykah Badu vibes (among others) in a way that I’m not sure anything else has. It’s dope.

## Fuck Gravity by Virtual Riot
This dude  can produce electronic music. For. Real.

## Spit on a Stranger by Pavement
I watched the music episode of that Netflix series “The Nineties” and it didn’t mention Pavement once. That show is cancelled.

## Modern Girl by Sleater Kinney
This song might have the best buildup to a drum part of all time.

## Above the Clouds by Gang Starr and Inspectah Deck
If you read this blog at all you already know how I feel about Gang Starr. This song is yet more proof that they are the greatest of all time.
