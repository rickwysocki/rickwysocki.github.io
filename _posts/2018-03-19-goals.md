A brief post:

In the coming weeks I’m planning to settle into a more regular work schedule. More writing, more reading, more time in the archives. Less messing around. Especially less time dorking around on social media. Part of the way I’m going to try to stay focused is update this blog more regularly discussing the steps I take toward long and short term goals. According to my journal, these goals include:

        - Write 3000 words of my dissertation in the next week and a half
        - Finish this website
        - Send out an article in June
        - Finish the EP I’ve been working on

Here’s to some productive work.
