I suppose I'm never going to regularly update this blog. But I figured that since the semester is wrapping up and we are in the throes of global catastrophe--likely moving toward war--it might be "fun" to drop in and post something.

Everything, literally, in the world is awful. All the institutions that shouldn't break down aren't; all those that must be dismantled are stronger than ever. There is no crisis that capital can't leech off of. The pandemic reveals every day that neither Democrats nor Republicans are capable of addressing the root causes of human suffering.

That's all I've got for todgay. Maybe there will be more to say about it tomorrow, or the next day.
