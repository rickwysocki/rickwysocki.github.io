Hey, y'all!

I put a new song up on my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/rlw1234) last night. I've been focusing a lot on the dissertation/job market (obviously) and some web design projects in my free time, so my music has been taking a little bit of a back seat.

If you don't know, music was one of my first loves (far earlier than academia, actually), and I produce electronic music as a hobby. I've been forever working on an EP that I'll put out someday. But not today.

Instead, last night I just convinced myself to compose something short that sounded nice and avoided falling into the familiar tracks of "overthinking it." So, here it is--if you like it, let me know!
