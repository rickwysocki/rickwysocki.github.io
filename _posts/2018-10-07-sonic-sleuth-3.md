Here's this week's "sonic sleuth" post, where I list ten songs I can't stop playing, and brief descriptions of why. <!--more-->Feel free to follow if you want to hear some cool songs and read some nerdy thoughts about music. I promise I'll try to deliver some every week.

## Dopamine by Franc Moody

The bass line is so good. So, so good. Reminds me of Teddy Prendergass and also the Ohio Players for some reason.

## Shouldn't Have Done That by Two Another

This song sounds like what I always wished Sam Smith sounded like. That's not to take anything away from either artist (I'm really digging this band and have always liked Sam Smith, too), but I can't get over the mix between the crooning vocals and the ethereal synthesizers here.

## Judy French by White Reaper

If you've ever lived in Louisville you can't not love White Reaper. This band rules.

## Dripping by Blonde Redhead

I got to see Blonde Redhead at a festival at some point (it was either Coachella or Austin City Limits) and it was fantastic. This band is incredible and deserves more props than it gets.

## What Would I Want? Sky by Animal Collective

Okay I know everyone and their dog's dad probably knows this song but I've been listening to it again lately. It's so dope that the Grateful Dead let Animal Collective sample "Unbroken Chain"--the first time the Dead had ever cleared a sample.

## First Time High (Remix of An Eluardian Instance by Of Montreal) by Recontructionist

I'm aware that this is a very complicated title. To be clear, it's a remix of an Of Montreal song by an artist called Reconstructionist. Not totally sure where I came across this, but I dig it, and am a forever-fan of Of Montreal.

## GOD. by Kendrick Lamar

Not trying to argue with anyone about this, but Kendrick is my personal favorite rapper. DAMN was such an incredible album (LOVE. is one of my all-time favorite songs). GOD. doesn't seem to get talked about as much as it should, though. So, here, listen to it and think about how great it is. If you want.

## Hustle Formation by The GO! Team

Seidenfaden's.

## Rock n Roll Star by Kero Kero Bonito

If you want to know what my musical taste is, this is a pretty good distillation of it. Occasionally glitchy electronic drums, 80s vibes, movement through a couple different moods, vocal harmonies--this song has it all.

## Shock Doctrine by STS9

This song brings me back to high school so hard. I love it. (As a political aside, also read Naomi Klein's book that this song is named after: *Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.*)
